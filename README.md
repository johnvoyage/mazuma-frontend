## Mazuma
Mazuma is an income/expense tracker and net worth calculator mean to improve financial literacy.

## Motivation
The motivation behind Mazuma was to merge my prior expertise (data, accounting, and finance) with programming.

## Build status
The build status is currently on hold. I am working on rebuilding it with a node back-end and any future updates will be posted here.

## Demo
Here is a demo of the app: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jv7uIrq7pMk&feature=youtu.be

## Tech/framework used
JavaScript front-end with:<br/>
React<br/>
Redux<br/>
Thunk<br/>
Semantic<br/>
JSON Web Tokens<br/>
Chart.js<br/>
<br/>
Ruby on Rails back-end

## Features
I believe the best features of Mazuma are in the tables, and graphing sections.

## Code Example
Some of the code I'm most proud of is all of the array methods used to ensure accurate data was calculated and presented: <br/>

## Installation
The npm should be set up so that all that needs to be run is npm install.
